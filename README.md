## Project Description

We aim to develop a robust voice command recognition system, capable of understanding and responding to specific spoken instructions.  
Our application aims to enable handicapped people to control the computer through AI-assisted mouse control.

## Motivation

[Provide instructions on how to get started with your project, including any necessary software or data. Include installation instructions and any prerequisites or dependencies that are required.]

## Research Method
[Describe the file structure of your project, including how the files are organized and what each file contains. Be sure to explain the purpose of each file and how they are related to one another.]


## Results
[Provide a summary of your findings and conclusions, including any recommendations or implications for future research. Be sure to explain how your results address your research question or problem statement.]

## Future Prospect
### Future Research and Development
The future of voice command recognition is incredibly promising, with continuous improvements in accuracy and responsiveness expected as technology advances. Our project lays the groundwork for further exploration and enhancement in this field. Future research could focus on:
1. Improving Recognition Accuracy: By incorporating more diverse and extensive datasets, we can improve the system's ability to recognize various accents and tones, making it more robust and reliable.
2. Expanding Command Vocabulary: Adding more commands and improving the system's ability to understand complex instructions can broaden its application scope.
3. Integration with AI and IoT: Combining voice recognition with artificial intelligence and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies can create smarter, more responsive environments.
